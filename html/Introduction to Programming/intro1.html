            <p>
                Computers electronic machines that are capable of storing, processing, sharing and displaying data. They
                are composed of hardware and software.

                <h3>Hardware:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are the physical components that are tangible such as processors, memory, monitor, keyboard,
                    etc.

                <h3>Software:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are a bunch of instructions that tell computers what to do. They are written in binary, a
                    series of 1 and 0 which is the only language that computers can understand.
                    <br><br>Software has two types; application and system.

                <h3>Application software:</h3>
                <p>
                    They are the software that users install and are used to perform certain tasks. It is a product or a
                    program that is designed only to fulfill end-users' requirements. Examples include applications such
                    as word processors, spreadsheet software, etc.

            <section id="system_software">
                <h3>System software:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are software that directly operates the computer hardware and provides the basic functionality
                    to the users as well as to the other software to operate smoothly. Example includes operating
                    systems, which are software that sit between the hardware and software. They allocate resources such
                    as memory and processor for applications to use. Modern operating systems also interact with users
                    via Graphical User Interface(GUI).
