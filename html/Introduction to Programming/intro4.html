        <h2 id="article_title">Where is Java used?</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the rise of new languages and frameworks, Java continues to be one of the most widely used languages in the world. It remains essential in many key areas of software development. Here are some of the most common uses of Java today:
        </p>

        <h3>Where Java Is Used Today:</h3>

        <section id="web_application_development">
            <h3>Web Application Development</h3>
            <p>
                Java is a major choice for building dynamic and large-scale web applications. Many big websites, e-commerce platforms, and enterprise systems run on Java because of its stability and security. Frameworks such as Spring, Struts, and Hibernate allow developers to create powerful and scalable web apps. These frameworks help manage security, databases, and server communication, making them ideal for high-traffic applications.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="mobile_application_development">
            <h3>Mobile Application Development</h3>
            <p>
                Java is the core language behind Android development, the operating system used by billions of smartphones worldwide. Android apps are written using Java-based tools, making Java an essential skill for mobile developers. Java is also used in some cross-platform mobile frameworks, allowing apps to run on both Android and other devices.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="enterprise_application_development">
            <h3>Enterprise Application Development</h3>
            <p>
                Many large companies rely on Java to build mission-critical systems. These systems need to be reliable, secure, and capable of handling thousands—or even millions—of transactions. Java is commonly used in:
                <ul>
                    <li>Banking and finance systems</li>
                    <li>Healthcare management platforms</li>
                    <li>E-commerce and online retail systems</li>
                    <li>Supply chain and logistics software</li>
                </ul>

                Frameworks such as JavaServer Faces (JSF), Java Persistence API (JPA), and Java Message Service (JMS) help create complex enterprise solutions that manage data, security, and communication efficiently.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="iot">
            <h3>Internet of Things (IoT)</h3>
            <p>
                As devices like smart appliances, sensors, and embedded systems continue to grow, Java has become a useful language for IoT development. IoT systems need lightweight, secure, and scalable code—qualities that Java provides. Frameworks such as Eclipse IoT, Kura, and ThingWorx help developers build applications that run on connected devices across homes, factories, and cities.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="ai_ml">
            <h3>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)</h3>
            <p>
                Java is gaining attention in the field of data science and AI. While languages like Python dominate this space, Java still plays a significant role in building high-performance systems for large-scale processing. Frameworks such as Apache Spark, Deeplearning4j, and H2O.ai allow developers to build machine learning models, handle big data, and process massive datasets efficiently.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="game_dev">
            <h3>Game Development</h3>
            <p>
                Java is also used to develop desktop and mobile games. Game engines like LibGDX and jMonkeyEngine rely on Java to create 2D and 3D games that run on multiple platforms. Java’s portability and strong performance make it a suitable choice for developers looking to create cross-platform game applications.
            </p>
        </section>
        
        <section id="web_servers_and_application_servers">
            <h3>Web Servers and Application Servers</h3>
            <p>
                Java powers many web servers, APIs, and backend systems. Application servers like Apache Tomcat, Jetty, and WildFly run Java applications and support business systems across the world. These servers help manage security, scalability, transaction processing, and connectivity—essential elements for enterprise-level software.
