        <h3>OOP</h3>
        <p>
          OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
          <br>If you've never used an object-oriented programming language before, you'll need to learn a few basic
          concepts before you can begin writing any code.

          <br><br>This article will discuss the basics of OOP such as the attributes and methods, class, and object.
          <br>And the main principles of OOP such as Encapsulation, Inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

      <section id="attributes">
        <h3>What are attributes?</h3>
        <p>
          Attributes – the data or characteristics

          <br><br>In java attributes, also known as fields or member variables, are variables declared within a class.
          These attributes define the properties or state of an object created from the class. Understanding class
          attributes is fundamental for object-oriented programming in Java.

          <br><br>Look at this image as an example.

      <section id="methods">
        <h3>What are methods</h3>
        <p>
          Methods - The Actions / Behaviors
          <br>Methods are actions that objects can perform.. They define what an object can do.
          <br>A method typically has:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Return type</b> – what value it gives back (int, String, void, etc.)</li>
          <li><b>Method name</b> – the identifier used to call it</li>
          <li><b>Parameters</b> – (optional) values passed into the method</li>
          <li><b>Method body</b> – the code that runs when the method is called</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A method in Java is a block of code that, when called, performs specific actions mentioned in it. For
          instance, if you have written instructions to draw a circle in the method, it will do that task. You can
          insert values or parameters into methods, and they will only be executed when called. They are also referred
          to as functions.
          <br>Take this block of code as an example,

      <section id="class">
        <h3>What is Class?</h3>
        <p>
          A class is a blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. This section defines a class that models
          the state and behavior of a real-world object. It intentionally focuses on the basics, showing how even a
          simple class can cleanly model state and behavior.
          <br>A class defines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Attributes</b> - the data stored (like name, age)</li>
          <li><b>Methods</b> - the actions the class can perform (like bark(), run(), eat())</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Here is a video on how to create a class from Neso Academy,</h3>

        <p>
          Programmers eventually discovered that it makes a program clearer and easier to understand if they were able
          to take a bunch of data and group it together with the functions that worked on that data. Such a grouping
          data and functions are called class and object. And writing programs by using classes is known as object
          oriented programming. 

          <br><br>Take this block of code as an example without objects.

        <p>Now another example with objects included,</p>
        <img src="../../images/Lessons/Lesson 4/with_object.png" alt="Class" class="article_screenshot">

        <p>
          In Java, a class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes, which are pieces of
          information that describe the object, and methods, which are actions the object can perform. For example, a
          Car class can have attributes like brand, color, and year, and methods like startEngine() and showDetails().

          <br><br>An object is a real instance created from the class. Each object can have its own values for the
          attributes while sharing the same methods. For instance, creating a Car object called myCar allows us to set
          its brand to "Toyota", color to "Red", and year to 2020. By calling myCar.startEngine() or
          myCar.showDetails(), the object performs actions defined in the class.

          <br><br>In short, the class provides the structure, and the object is the actual thing we use in the program.
          This separation of blueprint and instance is fundamental to object-oriented programming, making programs
          easier to understand and organize.

        <h3>What is an Object?</h3>
        <h4>Key Features of Objects:</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Attributes (Fields):</b> Describe the state of an object.</li>
          <li><b>Methods:</b> Define what an object can do.</li>
          <li><b>Instantiation:</b> Objects are created using the new keyword.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Objects are fundamental to grasping object-oriented technology. Observe your surroundings and you'll see
          numerous instances of actual items: your pet, your workspace, your TV, your bike.

          <br><br>Objects in the real world possess two traits: they each exhibit state and behavior. For example, Dogs
          possess attributes (name, color, breed, hunger) and actions (barking, fetching, tail wagging). Bicycles
          possess state (active gear, pedal cadence, velocity) and behavior (gear shifting, pedal cadence adjustment,
          brake application). Recognizing the state and behavior of real-world items is an excellent starting point for
          considering object-oriented programming principles.

        <p>
          In Java, objects are instances of classes, which act like blueprints. A class defines the attributes (data)
          and methods (actions) an object can have.

          <br><br>In our example, the Student class has three attributes: name, age, and course. It also has two
          methods: showDetails() to display the student’s information, and study() to show what the student is doing.

          <br><br>When we create student1 and student2 using the new keyword, we are making two separate objects from
          the Student class. Each object stores its own information. For example, student1 has the name "Alice" and
          course "Computer Science", while student2 has the name "Bob" and course "Mathematics".

          <br><br>By calling showDetails() and study() on each object, the program prints the details and actions of
          each student. The output clearly shows that each object works independently with its own data.

      <h3>OOP MAIN PRINCIPLES </h3>
      <p>
        One of the reasons Java is so popular is because it uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
        <br>OOP is a way of organizing code by using objects, which are like real-world things. For example, a Car can
        be an object. It has attributes (like color, brand, and year) and methods (things it can do, like startEngine or
        stop).

        <br><br>In OOP, we create classes which are like blueprints for objects. A class defines what attributes and
        methods the objects will have. Then, we can make many objects from the same class, each with its own unique
        values.
        <br>The main ideas in Java OOP are:

        <br><br>Class and Object – Class is the blueprint, object is the real thing.
        <br>Encapsulation – Keeping data safe inside the object and using methods to access it.
        <br>Inheritance – One class can use properties of another class to save time.
        <br>Polymorphism – Objects can do many things, depending on how we use them.
        <br>Abstraction – Hiding unnecessary details and showing only what is needed.

        <br><br>Since class and object is discussed on this article this section is focused more on the 4 main
        principles of Object Oriented Programming.

        <br><br>Before proceeding with the OOP concepts it is a good idea to learn more first about Access Modifiers in
        Java <a href="../Lessons/lessons1.html#access_modifiers">click this link</a> if you wish to know more and if you
        already know about it then you can proceed reading this section.

      </p>

      <section id="encapsulation">
        <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
        <h4>Key Features of Objects:</h4>
        <p>
          Encapsulation means protecting data by wrapping it inside a class and controlling how it is accessed.
          <br>Instead of allowing direct access to variables, we usually make them private and use getters and setters
          for controlled access.

          <br><br>If a class has a private variable balance, other classes cannot directly change it. They must use
          methods, preventing invalid data and keeping the object safe.

          <br><br>Why it matters:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Protects data from accidental changes
          <li>Makes the code easier to update</li>
          <li>Allows validation before changing values</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Example Code,
        </p>

        <img src="../../images/Lessons/Lesson 4/encapsulation example.PNG" alt="Encapsulation"
          class="article_screenshot">

        <p>
          In the Java programming language, and in many other languages, information hiding is controlled using
          getter/setter methods for data attributes that will be readable or that may be updated by other classes.

          <br><br>Information hiding means keeping your data safe and private inside a class so that other parts of the
          program cannot change it by accident.
          <br>To do this, we usually make our variables private, which means only the class itself can use them.

          <br><br>But… what if another class needs to read or update that data?
          <br>That’s where getters and setters come in. A getter is a small method that returns the value of a private
          variable. Think of it like looking through a window but not touching anything.

          <br><br>A setter is a method that changes the value of a private variable, but only in a controlled way.
          <br>Think of it like a secure door where only allowed changes can pass. By using getters and setters, Java
          makes sure that your data is safe, organized, and not changed in a wrong way. This helps prevent bugs and
          keeps your program easier to understand.

      <section id="inheritance">
        <h3>Inheritance</h3>
        <h4>Key Features of Objects:</h4>
        <p>
          Inheritance allows one class (child) to reuse the attributes and behaviors of another class (parent).
          <br>It prevents repeating the same code in multiple classes.

          <b><br></b>Example:
          <br><br>A class Car might inherit from a more general class Vehicle.
          <br><br>Then Car automatically gets attributes like speed, color, or methods like start() without rewriting
          them.

          <br><br>Why it matters:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reduces duplicate code</li>
          <li>Makes the program easier to expand</li>
          <li>Helps create logical hierarchies (e.g., Animal → Dog → Labrador)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Example Code,
        </p>

        <img src="../../images/Lessons/Lesson 4/inheritance example.PNG" alt="Inheritance" class="article_screenshot">

        <p>
          Java Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a new class to inherit
          properties and behaviors (fields and methods) from an existing class. This promotes code reusability and
          establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.

          <br><br>Inheritance in Java means that one class can take or borrow things (like variables and methods) from
          another class.

          <br><br>Think of it like this:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You have a parent class (also called the superclass).</li>
          <li>You create a child class (also called the subclass) that automatically gets everything the parent has.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It’s similar to how a child inherits traits from their parents in real life.

          <br><br>Why is this useful?
          <br>You don’t need to write the same code again — the child class can reuse the parent’s code.

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>It makes your code cleaner and easier to manage.</li>
          <li>It creates a clear family tree or hierarchy between classes.</li>
        </ul>

      <section id="polymorphism">
        <h3>Polymorphism</h3>
        <p>
          Polymorphism means one method can behave differently depending on the object calling it.

          <br><br>There are two types:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Compile-time polymorphism – Method Overloading</li>
          <li>Runtime polymorphism – Method Overriding</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Method overloading is a way to have more than one method in the same class with the same name, but with
          different inputs. The differences can be in the number of parameters, their types, or both. Overloading allows
          a class to perform similar operations in different ways without needing separate method names for each. The
          key point is that the program decides at compile time which version of the method to use, based on the number
          or type of arguments provided when the method is called. This makes the code easier to read and keeps method
          names consistent, even if the operations vary slightly.

        </p>

        <img src="../../images/Lessons/Lesson 4/method overloading.PNG" alt="Method overloading"
          class="article_screenshot">

        <p>
          Method overriding, on the other hand, happens when a child class provides its own version of a method that
          already exists in a parent class. The method in the child class must have the same name, same parameters, and
          same return type (or a compatible one). The main purpose of overriding is to allow the child class to give a
          specific behavior while still keeping the same interface as the parent. The program decides at runtime which
          method to execute, based on the actual object being used. This enables dynamic behavior in the program,
          allowing the same method call to act differently depending on the object, which is a key feature of
          object-oriented programming.
        </p>

        <img src="../../images/Lessons/Lesson 4/method overriding.PNG" alt="Method overriding"
          class="article_screenshot">

        <p>
          Example:
          <br>A method makeSound() can produce different sounds:
          <br>A Dog object → “Bark”
          <br>A Cat object → “Meow”

          <br><br>Even though the method name is the same, the behavior changes depending on the object's actual type.

          <br><br>Why it matters:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Makes code flexible</li>
          <li>Supports dynamic behavior</li>
          <li>Useful for GUI apps, games, and frameworks</li>

        <p>
          Polymorphism in Java is one of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects to
          behave differently based on their specific class type. The word polymorphism means having many forms, and it
          comes from the Greek words poly (many) and morph (forms), this means one entity can take many forms. In Java,
          polymorphism allows the same method or object to behave differently based on the context, specially on the
          project's actual runtime class.

          <br><br>The word polymorphism literally means “many forms.”

          <br><br>Think of it like this:
          <br>You have one method name, but it can act differently depending on the class that uses it.
          <br>Or you have one object reference, but it can point to different types of objects at runtime.

          <br><br>A simple real-life example:

          <br><br>Imagine you tell different animals to “makeSound()”.

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>A Dog will bark.</li>
          <li>A Cat will meow.</li>
          <li>A Cow will moo</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Same command but different result. That is polymorphism.

        <h3>Abstraction</h3>
        <p>
          Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only what the user needs.

          <br><br>Example:
          <br>When you use a method startEngine(), you do not need to know what wires or parts are needed to start a car
          engine. You just call the method. In Java, abstraction can be achieved through:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Abstract classes</li>
          <li>Interfaces</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          An abstract class is like a blueprint for other classes. It can have methods with or without a body. The
          methods without a body (abstract methods) must be implemented by child classes, while the methods with a body
          can be used as-is. You cannot create objects directly from an abstract class.

          <br><br>Sample code with abstract class,

        </p>

          class="article_screenshot">

        <p>
          An interface is like a contract for classes. It only contains method declarations (no body, except
          default/static methods). Any class that implements the interface must provide the behavior for all methods. A
          class can implement multiple interfaces, which is a way to achieve multiple inheritance in Java.

          <br><br>Sample code with interface,

        </p>

          Why Abstraction matters:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Reduces complexity</li>
          <li>Helps focus on important features</li>
          <li>Makes large systems easier to design</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Abstraction in Java refers to hiding the implementation details of a code and exposing only the necessary
          information to the user. It provides the ability to simplify complex systems by ignoring irrelevant details
          and reducing complexity.

          <br><br>Abstraction in Java means hiding the complicated details of how something works and showing only
          what’s necessary.

          <br><br>Think of it like using a TV remote:

        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You don’t need to know how the remote sends signals or how the TV processes them.</li>
          <li>You just press the buttons you need (like power, volume, or channel), and it works.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In programming, abstraction works the same way:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>You create a class or method that does something for the user.</li>
          <li>The user only sees what it does, not how it does it.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This makes programs simpler, easier to understand, and less confusing, especially for large or complex
          systems.
