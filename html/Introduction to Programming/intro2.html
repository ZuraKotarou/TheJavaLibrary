            <h2 id="article_title">What is programming and programming languages?</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we know what computers are, let’s define what is programming and programming languages.
                Programming is the act of writing codes which tells what to do. It’s like giving a series of
                instructions that the computer will follow. To do this, we use programming languages. They are the
                foundation of software development, allowing developers to create applications, websites, and systems
                through computer-understandable instructions. They use syntax, a set of rules that programmers must
                adhere to when writing codes. They bridge human logic to computer execution.

                <br><br>When writing programs, programmer often run into errors, also known as bugs. There are three
                types of these errors; syntax,logic and runtime errors. The process of finding and fixing these errors
                are known as debugging.
            </p>

            <section id="syntax_errors">
                <h3>Syntax errors:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are errors pertaining to syntax such as misspelled keywords.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="logic_errors">
                <h3>Logic errors:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are errors where the program doesn’t have any syntax errors but doesn’t provide the intended
                    output or function. They are mainly related to wrong logic from the side of the developer.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="runtime_errors">
                <h3>Runtime errors:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are errors that the computer only discovers when the program is running. They could cause the
                    program to close unexpectedly if not handled properly.

                    <br><br>Programming languages are also classified based on how they approach programming. We have
                    low-level and high-level languages.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="low_level_languages">
                <h3>Low-Level Languages:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are languages that are close to machine code. They offer more control over hardware resources
                    and are used to achieve maximum efficiency and performance. But because they provide minimal
                    abstraction from hardware, they are harder to write and debug. Examples of these languages includes
                    Assembly and Machine code.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="high_level_languages">
                <h3>High-Level Languages:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are languages that offer human readable codes. They hide the complexity of machine
                    instructions into phrases that can easily be understood by humans, letting developers focus on logic
                    and functionality. They are designed to make coding faster and simpler. They also allow for easier
                    debugging. These human readability comes in the cost of performance and consumes more hardware
                    resources. Examples of these languages includes Java, Python, and JavaScript.

                    <br><br>There are also different ways on how programs written in different programming languages are
                    run. It useful to know the difference between Compiled and Interpreted Languages.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="compiled_language">
                <h3>Compiled Language:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are languages that uses a compiler which converts the source code, which is the code that the
                    programmer writes into a machine code that the computer can understand. These are generally faster
                    that interpreted languages and can catch errors before compilation. Java is an example of a compiled
                    language.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="interpreted_language">
                <h3>Interpreted Language:</h3>
                <p>
                    These are languages that uses an interpreter which processes the code line by line instead of
                    compiling the whole source code at once. Because of this, these languages are slower. they do offer
                    programmers the ability to debug during runtime. Examples of interpreted languages includes Python,
                    JavaScript, etc.

                    <br><br>There are also different programming models that defines how we write our code to solve a
                    problem. The most commonly used are Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

            <section id="procedural_programming">
                <h3>Procedural Programming:</h3>
                <p>
                    Procedural Programming can be defined as a programming model which is derived from structured
                    programming, based upon the concept of calling procedure. Procedures, also known as routines,
                    subroutines or functions, simply consist of a series of computational steps to be carried out.
                    During a program's execution, any given procedure might be called at any point, including by other
                    procedures or itself. In short, it uses a top-down approach, where it follows a sequence of steps to
                    solve a problem.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section id="object_oriented_programming">
                <h3>Object-Oriented Programming:</h3>
                <p>
                    Object-oriented programming can be defined as a programming model which is based upon the concept of
                    objects. Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods. In
                    object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed using the concept of objects that
                    interact with the real world. It follows a bottom-up approach where every objects needed to solve a
                    problem is assembled first before formulating a logic that utilizes these objects to arrive at a
                    solution. Object-oriented programming languages are various but the most popular ones are
                    class-based, meaning that classes serves as a blueprint for objects, and objects are an instance of
                    their class.
