        <h2 id="article_title">What is Java?</h2>
        <p>
            Let’s explore one of the most widely used and influential programming languages in the world—Java. Java is an object-oriented programming language created in 1995, and today it powers billions of devices around the globe. From laptops and smartphones to medical devices, game consoles, and servers, Java has become a core foundation on which countless modern applications are built.

            <br><br>One of the key reasons Java became so popular is its portability. When Java was first invented by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1991, the main goal was simple: “write once, run anywhere.” This means that once you write a Java program on one device, you can run it on almost any other device without rewriting the code. This is possible because Java uses the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which allows Java code to run on any system that supports it.

            <br><br>It is also important to understand that Java is completely different from JavaScript, despite their similar names. JavaScript runs mainly in web browsers and does not need compilation, while Java must be compiled before it runs. Java can also run on desktops, servers, and mobile devices—not just inside a browser.

            <br><br>Even in a world where new tools and languages seem to appear constantly, Java remains one of the most popular programming languages. It continues to compete strongly with languages like Python, C++, PHP, Ruby, and Swift. This long-lasting popularity makes Java a valuable skill in the job market, especially for enterprise-scale applications.

            <h3>How Java Works?</h3>
            <p>
                To develop with Java, you need to download the Java Development Kit (JDK), available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You write your program in Java, and then the Java compiler converts your code into Java bytecode, an intermediate form of instructions understood by the JVM.

                <br><br>The JVM, which is part of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), reads and executes this bytecode. Because JVMs exist on many different operating systems, your compiled Java program can run almost anywhere without modification.

                <br><br>Java also provides a Java API, an extensive library of tools for handling objects, networking, security, XML, databases, and web services. Together, the JVM, Java API, and development tools form the Java platform—one of the most powerful and reliable environments for building enterprise software.
